# NLP- hate-speech-detection-using-TR-tweets
  This project leverages NLP and machine learning to detect hate speech in Turkish tweets. It classifies text into **neutral (0), hate speech (1), and offensive (2)** using **Word2Vec** and **XGBoost**. Built with **Flask**, it provides a REST API for real-time analysis. **Zemberek NLP** enhances text preprocessing for accurate detection.
